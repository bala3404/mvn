root@ubuntu-14:~# sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/debian binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'

Once your system is updated, execute the command below for the installation of Jenkins and type the `Y` key to proceed with the installation process.

Conclusion
Jenkins is an incredibly powerful tool. While not as nice to set up and manage as some other build servers, it is incredibly powerful with a lot of flexibility, and to be honest, it’s really hard to complain about an enterprise level build server for free.
